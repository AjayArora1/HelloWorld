Creating a repository to help myself learn how GitHub works, for Assignment 6 in my COMP 3521 course.

Hello World!

I have written this on a new branch.
I am starting to understand GitHub and how it is useful for quality and configuration management. Thanks for the links to the tutorials David Kumka!
